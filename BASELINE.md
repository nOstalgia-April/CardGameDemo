# Baseline Checklist (Current Behavior)

- Hand shows cards on start.
- Drag a card to place a unit on a cell.
- Fog blocks placing units outside visible cells.
- Enemy spawns at center on start.
- End turn resolves unit AI/attacks and starts next turn.

Note: Run once to confirm baseline before refactors.
